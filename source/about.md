I am a mathematician and software engineer located in Florianópolis, Brazil. I have a 5-year-old son and enjoy crocheting, knitting, cross-stitch embroidery and all sorts of crafts.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing by the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil), M.S. in Mathematics by the same university and a Ph.D. in Applied Math by the Facultés Universitaires Notre Dame de la Paix, in Namur (Belgium) where I was advised by Professor Philippe Toint.

I'm currently working at Quansight. At this time, I'm on a leave as a professor of the Department of Mathematics at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 

My interests include smooth optimization (mainly nonlinear programming), numerical analysis, the numerical solution of large-scale linear systems and the implementation of software for scientific computing.
