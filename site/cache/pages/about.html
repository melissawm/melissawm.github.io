<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I am a mathematician and software engineer located in Florianópolis, Brazil. I have a 6-year-old son and enjoy crocheting, knitting, cross-stitch embroidery and all sorts of crafts. I am interested in math, programming, free/open source software and communities, crafts, science fiction and parenting. My pronouns are she/her. </p>
<p>I work at <a href="https://quansight.com/">Quansight</a>, and dedicate my time to <a href="https://numpy.org">NumPy</a> and other open source projects. I care deeply about teaching, mentoring, and have been involved in the Python community for some time. You can find most of my talk slides on GitHub; feel free to use those according to the licenses stated in each repo. </p>

<h1>My background</h1>
<p>I have a B.S. in Mathematics and Scientific Computing by the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil), M.S. in Mathematics by the same university and a Ph.D. in Applied Math by the Facultés Universitaires Notre Dame de la Paix, in Namur (Belgium) where I was advised by Professor Philippe Toint.</p>
<p>After my Ph.D., I spent 9 years as a professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil), teaching, doing some research and other administrative work at the Math Department. My research interests include smooth optimization (mainly nonlinear programming), numerical analysis, the numerical solution of large-scale linear systems and the implementation of software for scientific computing.</p>
