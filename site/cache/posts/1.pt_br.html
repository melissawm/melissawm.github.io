<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I am a software engineer at <a class="reference external" href="https://quansight.com/">Quansight</a>, working on <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and other open source projects. I care deeply about teaching, mentoring, and have been involved in the Python community for some time. You can find most of my talk slides on github; feel free to use those according to the licenses stated in each repo. I am interested in math, programming, free/open source software and communities, crafts, science fiction and parenting. My pronouns are she/her. You can find me on <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/melissawm/">Twitter</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://linkedin.com/in/axequalsb/">LinkedIn</a>, or via email at <cite>melissawm&#64;gmail.com</cite>.</p>
