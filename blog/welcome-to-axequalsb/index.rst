Hi there!

I am a software engineer at Quansight_, working on NumPy_ and other open source projects. I care deeply about teaching, mentoring, and have been involved in the Python community for some time. You can find most of my talk slides on github; feel free to use those according to the licenses stated in each repo. I am interested in math, programming, free/open source software and communities, crafts, science fiction and parenting. My pronouns are she/her. You can find me on Twitter_ and LinkedIn_, or via email at ``melissawm@gmail.com``.
